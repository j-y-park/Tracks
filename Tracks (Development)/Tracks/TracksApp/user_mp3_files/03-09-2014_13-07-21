 Attempted to access an unloaded appdomain. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131014)

TODO:
In app globally:
	
x- Change admin role to user + additional rights (instead of different rights that do not overlap).
	---- not sure how this will work. if an admin makes a request for someone else, who should the user be? will request be attached to the admin user? or will a new user need to be created, and then the request attached to said new user?
        
x- Use current add/remove user mechanism (not hard-coded username) 


On all pages: 
x- Please separate input from view via EDIT control  

On the admin view page: 
x- Change user field to contact  
x- Change request field to Application Name

x- fix bug in [httppost] request_manager
x- check usernames in create user against AD
x- implement date control
x- stripstring on all inputs
x- add defaults for dropdowns
x- need a way to attach questions to a request. not all requests 		will have same questions, depending on whether questions 	were deleted/added. in other words, need some form of logging
x- validate dates
- admin request: sort requests by date
- pagination?
x- add question type "hp email" which validates hp email text?
x- portfolio id, it-owner, application name, and description will be fundamental to a request.
-TT: priority - base, elevated
x- change requestor to contact. use email address across app.
	- AD: alias, email address, display name
	

x- validate HP email fields
x- implement AJAX for Question(Model) is_active
x- create delete request methods for admin
x- test admin create request

x- credentials field: textarea type
x- consultant tab

- error pages
x- email dropdown correspondants
x- implement complete save state for template of request
x- cleanup "viewbag.title"'s
x- change stripstring behavior to the following: strip any characters in the string which aren't alpha-numeric characters or spacebar character.
- remove <compilation debug="true"/>
<customErrors mode="Off">
</customErrors>
from the tracking tool web.config file when deployed fully.
x- application version = textfield in view request of TT. manual project entry field in TT which is link with query string containing id, application name, and maybe application version.
x- add consultant field to intake form
x- add link from TT to intake form for consultant to view questions
	- consultant can view requests assigned to himself
	- consultant can edit request which he is contact of
https://gcstools.americas.hpqcorp.net/GCS/Intake/User_Requests_View?request_id=29
x- about us and contact us links for intake form
- if a user is a consultant and is assigned to a request, what happens if the user is dropped from being a consultant? right now the request will still have that user as a consultant, but it will not show up in the TT.
x- finish consultant dropdown in intake form
x- add "consultant view" to user_request page
- stripstring on all inputs
x- test "consultant view" and consultant dropdown in intake form and TT
x- make TT tabs a dropdown, and try to make configurable.
	---- HOW SHOULD CONFIGURATION WORK?
		---- create new table called "TrackingToolNote" table
			fields: ID, (foreign key) requestID, edittype, notes
x- make link to intake form Q&A available to all consultants
x- BU a read-only field pulled from the intake form

x- make it so that an admin user cannot un-admin himself
x- in user request index, allow consultant to see his requests
	-- need to test
x- have link in emails directing to the intake form/TT
	----- no link in email from intake form. this is b/c intake form email
		is the consultant assignment, which means consultant should visit
		the TT.
x- calculated risk, non-editable field in TT calculated by formula. 
x- manual risk, dropdown editable in TT.
- change request.consultant to request.consultantID (change from using names to using ID's). do this for pentester and toolingengineer too. (or use User model object, instead of string or id).
x- add (and pull) keys in web.config's of TT and Intake referencing to the url of the other site
- currently if a file is uploaded, then it is not possible to "un-upload" a file. in other words, if a file has been uploaded before, if a user comes and edits a request but leaves the file question blank, then the blank will not count as an "un-upload".the previous file will still show in the download control of the request_view.
- if product name is changed in TT, it is not reflected as a change to the answer of the product name question.
x- allow show/hide of inactive questions in intake form
	x---- edit so show/hide state is preserved?
x- allow reordering of questions in intake form
- look into choices within choices for Q&A of intake form
- look into having multiple contacts
	-------
	let user property hold the person who makes the request.
	let contacts property hold list of contacts added.
	-------
- make GUID field for requests
- source changed to url in TT, source code location textbox in TT
x- fix visual bug regarding radio buttons
x- allow show/hide and search of users
- should StripString also be in TT? (should those inputs also be stripped?)
